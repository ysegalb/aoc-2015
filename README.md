# Advent of Code 2015

This repository contains solutions for the 2015 edition of Advent of Code, a series of small programming puzzles released daily in December 2015.

The solutions are written in Go as I wanted to learn that language, and are organized by day, with each day's solution in a separate file. The puzzles can be found at the [Advent of Code website](http://adventofcode.com/2015).

## Usage

To run a solution, navigate to the directory corresponding to a day of the puzzle and execute the test file.
